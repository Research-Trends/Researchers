By 2032, the market is expected to reach <strong>$25 billion</strong>, indicating a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around <strong>10%.</strong></p> <p>The rising consumer preference for organic food is a vital driver fueling the demand for natural fertilizers. Growers are increasingly seeking environmentally friendly and sustainable solutions to enhance soil health and crop productivity. The surge in the organic food sector, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of <strong>9% from 2024 to 2032</strong>, complements the natural fertilizer market's expansion. In addition, government incentives and regulatory support for organic farming are expected to further boost market growth during this period.</p> <p>In terms of product type, the market is segmented into various categories, including plant-based, animal-based, and mineral-based fertilizers. Among these, plant-based fertilizers are expected to dominate the market share, owing to their organic growth advantages and better absorption by plants. Furthermore, the mineral-based fertilizers segment is projected to experience considerable growth due to the increasing awareness of soil micronutrient management.</p> <p>Technological advancements and innovations in the development of natural fertilizers are also contributing to market growth. There is a strong focus on research and development aimed at improving fertilizer efficiency and efficacy. New formulations are being introduced that combine nutrients to better meet the demands of various crops, further enhancing their appeal in the agricultural sector.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>The market fragmentation presents numerous opportunities for new entrants and established players alike, as manufacturers seek to expand their product offerings and distribution networks.
